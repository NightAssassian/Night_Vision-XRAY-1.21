# Night_Vision
the ULTIMATE resource pack (made by me :3)
i mean its pretty straight forward if u dont know how to put a resource pack in a resource pack folder just follow this guide.

step 1: type win + r for run
step 2: type in run "appdata" (without the brackets)
step 3: go to roaming then .minecraft folder
step 4: find the resourcepacks folder
step 5: put the zip file inside of the resourcepacks folder

how to enable it in minecraft:
i mean theres no real way to enable it without meteor client or none ( for me it works with meteor client xray)
but what u do is
when ur at minecraft game u go and press options after that u go and press resource packs then u will see the night vision.zip resource pack and put it in selected then just boot up minecraft and enjoy!
